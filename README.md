## What is Electrobun?

> Electron is in the **_very_** early stages. We currently only support development on arm macs, it has memory leaks, has no tests, it's not available in npm yet, and many core things are still missing.

Electrobun aims to be a complete **solution-in-a-box** for building, updating, and shipping ultra fast, tiny, and cross-platform desktop applications written in Typescript.
Under the hood it uses <a href="https://bun.sh">bun</a> to execute the main process and to bundle webview typescript, and has native bindings written in <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a>.

**Project Goals**

- Write typescript for the main process and webviews without having to think about it.
- Isolation between main and webview processes with fast RPC between them.
- Decouple shipping Bun and Web runtimes from shipping your application code.
- Small app bundles < 5MB
- Provide everything you need in one tightly integrated workflow to start writing code in 5 minutes and distribute in 10.
